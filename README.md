# Technical Test Projects

This repository contains two projects completed as part of a technical test:   
1. **Flask-Test-API**: A simple REST API built with Flask.
2. **ReactNative-Test**: A basic mobile app with navigation.   

Each project is located in its respective folder. Below are the details for each task.

  - `PUT /tasks/<id>`: Updates an existing task.  
  - `DELETE /tasks/<id>`: Deletes a task.  
- Ensured responses are returned in JSON format.  

### Bonus
